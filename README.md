# FriendFinder
A quiz to find which friend is most like you!

An Express app that prompts the user with an HTML quiz, accepts the answers and compares them in our server to find a like-ness with another users' answers. 

Results of the quiz are stored as an array and compared for total difference between the object arrarys in Friends.js

Once the best/closest match it found, a modal with the matching person's name, and img should appear and that is your new best friend!

Still working on the routing to work correctly...
